# Semantic Health Fullstack Take Home Assignment (PageRank)

For this project, the goal is to build a quick graph implementation and
visualization, implement a function that calculates the PageRank of a node,
and write tests of their functionality.

This repo contains a simple graph implementation that allows users to, via a frontend interface:
- Add nodes to a graph
- Add edges to a graph
- Get neighboring nodes given a node (directed or undirected as you prefer)
